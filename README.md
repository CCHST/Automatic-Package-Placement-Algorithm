# Automatic Package Placement Algorithm

In this project, we designed and implemented an algorithm for automatic package placement recommendations. The algorithm aimed to optimize the placement of packages on shelves, resulting in a 17% increase in the number of packages shelved and a 21% reduction in drivers' in-store time.

### Key Achievements:
- Developed an algorithm to automate package placement recommendations.
- Increased the efficiency of package shelving by 17%.
- Reduced drivers' in-store time by 21%, improving overall operational efficiency.

This project showcases our commitment to enhancing operational processes through innovative algorithms and improving service efficiency in logistics operations.
